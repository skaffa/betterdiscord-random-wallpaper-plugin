# betterdiscord-random-wallpaper-plugin

This plugin sets you Discord background to a random image (See array in plugin file)

Please create an issue for bugs, feedback or suggestions.


I recommend using this with a transparent theme (One that does not have the default opacity)


Coming soon:
    -toggle image categories
    -select boot/interval
    -custom backgrounds
